# TrenchCoatsManager
 A trench coats manager application, providing two application modes: admin and user mode. The user can also add trench coats to a shopping basket which is stored externally.
 
 
 ## Features
 - a window lets the user choose the application mode (```user``` or ```admin``` mode). Also, the user is allowed to ```change``` the type of file (between ```CSV``` and ```HTML```) where the shopping basket is displayed (providing the user enters user mode and adds something to the basket)
 - multiple undo/redo functionality for the add, remove, update operations and for all the features related to the shopping basket (e.g., adding a product to the shopping basket)
 - key combinations for the undo/redo functionality (```Ctrl-Z``` and ```Ctrl-Y```) 
 
 ### Admin mode features:
 - display a table with all the available trench coats and their representative photos (for each trench coat, its color matches the one of the trench coat in the image)
 - add a new trench coat
 - remove an existing trench coat
 - update an existing trench coat
 - display statistics: a pie chart of all the available sizes
 - switch to user mode

 ### User mode features:
